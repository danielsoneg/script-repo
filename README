A Collection of Various Useful Scripts
======================================
I'll be storing various useful scripts I've found in this repo. These scripts are made primarily for personal use, so there will be some quirks, but feel free to clean them up.

Current List:
-------------
* fixFileMode.sh
    
    Repairs permissions on a web folder - Folders get 755, Files 644.
    
    Note: Just changes permissions, not owner.
    
    Usage: sudo ./fixFileMode.sh "target dir"

* passless.sh

    Configures password-less login on remote SSH servers

    Usage: passless.sh user server [port]

    Port is optional - defaults to 22.
